The Asset package is comprosed of several packages. The key concepts of an Asset are as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Assets can have names, through inheritance to the Naming package</li>
	<li>Assets are physical entities which have a lifecycle</li>
	<li>One or more assets can be associated to create a PowerSystemResource</li>

The following sections describe the packages in the Assets package.
The AssetBasics package defines the relationship between Asset and other classes, such as Organization, PowerSystemResource and Document.
Point assets are those assets whose physical location can be described in terms of a single coordinate, such as a pole or a switch.
Linear assets are those assets whose physical location is best described in terms of a line, plyline or polygon.
