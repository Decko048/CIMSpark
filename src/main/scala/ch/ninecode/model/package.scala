package ch.ninecode

/**
 * ==Overview==
 * Provides Common Information Model (CIM) classes for electrical, topological, asset, spatial
 * and other categories of objects that are germane to electric network operations.
 *
 * Some examples are shown in the following image:
 *
 * <img src="https://rawgit.com/derrickoswald/CIMSparkPresentation/master/img/information.svg" width="700">
 *
 * These classes are the types of, and objects contained in, the RDD that are created by the CIMReader,
 * e.g. RDD[Switch].
 *
 * Classes are nested according to the hierarchical package structure found in CIM.
 *
 * Each class has the reference to its parent class, available as the generic <code>sup</code> field,
 * and also as a typed reference of the same name as the parent class.
 *
 * This is illustrated in the following image, where the object with id TE1932 (a Switch) is found in
 * RDD[Switch] and all RDD for which the relation 'a Switch "Is A" <em>X</em>' holds,
 * e.g. RDD[ConductingEquipment]:

 *
 * The packages and their descriptions are itemized below.
 *
 * A short summary of all classes is found below that.
 * The classes can be ordered by package (Grouped) or alphabetically.
 * The classes are alos listed in the panel on the left for easy reference.
 *
 * ===AssetInfo===
 * This package is an extension of Assets package and contains the core information classes that support asset management and different network and work planning applications with specialized AssetInfo subclasses.
 *
 * They hold attributes that can be referenced by not only Asset-s or AssetModel-s but also by ConductingEquipment-s.
 *
 *
 * ===Assets===
 * This package contains the core information classes that support asset management applications that deal with the physical and lifecycle aspects of various network resources (as opposed to power system resource models defined in IEC61970::Wires package, which support network applications).
 *
 *
 * ===AsynchronousMachineDynamics===
 * An asynchronous machine model represents a (induction) generator or motor with no external connection to the rotor windings, e.g., squirrel-cage induction machine.
 *
 * The interconnection with the electrical network equations may differ among simulation tools.  The program only needs to know the terminal to which this asynchronous machine is connected in order to establish the correct interconnection.  The interconnection with motorï¿½s equipment could also differ due to input and output signals required by standard models.
 *
 *
 * ===AuxiliaryEquipment===
 * Contains equipment which is not normal conducting equipment such as sensors, fault locators, and surge protectors.
 *
 * These devices do not define power carrying topological connections as conducting equipment, but are associated to terminals of other conducting equipment.
 *
 *
 * ===Common===
 * This package contains the information classes that support distribution management in general.
 *
 *
 * ===CongestionRevenueRights===
 * Congestion rent is a major, highly volatile charge currently faced by many participants in the LMP-based electrical energy markets.
 *
 * For this reason, the ISOs offer congestion revenue rights (CRR), also known as financial transmission rights or transmission congestion contracts. These are financial instruments that allow market participants to hedge against congestion charges when they schedule their generation, load and bilateral energy transactions.

 *
 *

 *
 *
 * ===Core===
 * Contains the core PowerSystemResource and ConductingEquipment entities shared by all applications plus common collections of those entities.
 *
 * Not all applications require all the Core entities.  This package does not depend on any other package except the Domain package, but most of the other packages have associations and generalizations that depend on it.

 *
 * For these situations, discontinuous excitation control signals may be employed to enhance stability following large transient disturbances.</font>
 *

 * Overexcitation limiters (OELs) are also referred to as <i>maximum excitation limiters </i>and <i>field current limiters. </i>The possibility of voltage collapse in stressed power systems increases the importance of modelling these limiters in studies of system conditions that cause machines to operate at high levels of excitation for a sustained period, such as voltage collapse or system-islanding.
 *
 * Such events typically occur over a long time frame compared with transient or small-signal stability simulations.
 *
 *
 * ===PFVArControllerType1Dynamics===
 * <font color="#0f0f0f">Excitation systems for synchronous machines are sometimes supplied with an optional means of automatically adjusting generator output reactive power (VAr) or power factor (PF) to a user-specified value This can be accomplished with either a reactive power or power factor controller or regulator.
 *
 * A reactive power or power factor controller is defined as a PF/VAr controller in IEEE Std 421.1 as ï¿½A control function that acts through the reference adjuster to modify the voltage regulator set point to maintain the synchronous machine steady-state power factor or reactive power at a predetermined value.ï¿½ </font>
 *
 *
 * ===PFVArControllerType2Dynamics===

 *
 * A variety of input signals may be used depending on the particular design.
 *
 *
 * ===Production===
 * The production package is responsible for classes which describe various kinds of generators.
 *
 * These classes also provide production costing information which is used to economically allocate demand among committed units and calculate reserve quantities.
 *
 *

 *
 *
 * ===StandardInterconnections===
 * This section describes the standard interconnections for various types of equipment.
 *
 * These interconnections are understood by the application programs and can be identified based on the presence of one of the key classes with a relationship to the static power flow model: SynchronousMachineDynamics, AsynchronousMachineDynamics, EnergyConsumerDynamics or WindTurbineType3or4Dynamics.
 *
 *
 * ===StandardModels===
 * This section contains standard dynamic model specifications grouped into packages by standard function block (type of equipment being modelled).

 *
 *
 * ===StateVariables===
 * State variables for analysis solutions such as powerflow.

 *
 *
 * ===TurbineGovernorDynamics===
 * The turbine-governor model is linked to one or two synchronous generators and determines the shaft mechanical power (Pm) or torque (Tm) for the generator model.
 *
 * Unlike IEEE standard models for other function blocks, the three IEEE turbine-governor standard models (GovHydroIEEE0, GovHydroIEEE2, GovSteamIEEE1) are documented in IEEE Transactions not in IEEE standards. For that reason, diagrams are supplied for those models.
 *
 *
 * ===TurbineLoadControllerDynamics===
 * A turbine load controller acts to maintain turbine power at a set value by continuous adjustment of the turbine governor speed-load reference.
 *
 *
 * ===UnderexcitationLimiterDynamics===
 * Underexcitation limiters (UELs) act to boost excitation.
 *
 * The UEL typically senses either a combination of voltage and current of the synchronous machine or a combination of real and reactive power. Some UELs utilize a temperature or pressure recalibration feature, in which the UEL characteristic is shifted depending upon the generator cooling gas temperature or pressure.
 *
 *
 * ===UserDefinedModels===
 * This section contains user-defined dynamic model classes to support the exchange of both proprietary and explicitly defined user-defined models.
 * <u>
 * </u><u>Proprietary models</u> represent behaviour which, while not defined by a standard model class, is mutually understood by the sending and receiving applications based on the name passed in the .name attribute of the appropriate xxxUserDefined class.
 *
 * Proprietary model parameters are passed as general attributes using as many instances of the ProprietaryParameterDynamics class as there are parameters.
 *
 *
 * ===VoltageAdjusterDynamics===
 * <font color="#0f0f0f">A voltage adjuster is a reference adjuster that uses inputs from a reactive power or power factor controller to modify the voltage regulator set point to maintain the synchronous machine steady-state power factor or reactive power at a predetermined value. </font>
 *
 * <font color="#0f0f0f">For additional information please refer to IEEE Standard 421.5-2005, Section 11.</font>
 *
 *

 * <font color="#0f0f0f">Synchronous machine terminal voltage transducer and current compensator models</font> adjust the terminal voltage feedback to the excitation system by adding a quantity that is proportional to the terminal current of the generator.
 *
 * It is linked to a specific generator (synchronous machine).
 *
 *
 * ===WindDynamics===

 *
 * The 4 types have the following characteristics:
 *
 *
 * ===Wires===
