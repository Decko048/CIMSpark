CIMSpark
======

Spark access to Common Information Model (CIM) files.

# Overview

This project joins the two worlds of the
[Apache Spark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark) computation model and the
Common Information Model ([CIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Information_Model_(electricity))) data model.


A good overview presentation is [Network Analysis and Simulation using Apache Spark on Compute Clusters](https://derrickoswald.github.io/CIMSparkPresentation/index.html?audio), or [without the audio tracks](https://derrickoswald.github.io/CIMSparkPresentation).

# Model

The CIM model as implemented by this software is described in [CIM Model](Model.md)
and is described in detail in the [ScalaDoc](https://derrickoswald.github.io/CIMSpark).
